The steps I followed to use the SFTP command-line tool:
1- I opened the command prompt on my local machine.
2- I connected to my sandbox environment using SFTP. I needed to include my sandbox hostname and password.
3- I navigated to the directory where my screenshot exists.
4- I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshot from my local machine to my sandbox environment.
5- I checked the sandbox directory where I uploaded the screenshot to confirm that it have been successfully transferred.
